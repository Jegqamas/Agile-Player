- Added ability to switch CPS (Clocks Per Seconds) and Buffer Size in the main window.
- Added new shortcuts to switch CPS and Buffer Size.

Notes:
I have a theory that says that songs/tracks that recorded in Euro region uses machines that clock at speed of 50 cps (as same as 50 fps), the
other ones that recorded in the US region clocks at 60 cps. So this where the cps switching ability comes in, simply cps can be switched to suit the audio
that being played. 
Buffer size effect quality, latency and performance. Compined with CPS settings, it should get better hearing experiens.
CPS and Buffer Size can be set in the settings dialog as well, in case setting custom settings.
